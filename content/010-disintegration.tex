%\section{Disintegration}
%The motivation for disintegration stems from the problem of zero-measures
%in a dimension of a probability distribution. Expectations of probability
%distributions on continuous spaces is defined to be the volume of the
%object the distribution spans. This, however, poses a problem, when we have
%observations on a given point: Points do not have any volume in a continuous
%space.

%This problem can be solved using disintegration \cite{Shan:2016}.

%A formal semantics of disintegration interprets the transformation into
