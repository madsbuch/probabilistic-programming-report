\section{Semantics}
After the above formulations of probability distributions, a natural question
is to what extent we can express the probability distributions we
usually do. To answer this question, we look into the semantics of the
probability distributions

In \cite{Ramsey:2002}, they develop an interpretation of the probability through
stochastic lambda calculus. This translation shows the generality of the probability
monad. In his monad, we can implement the usual stochastic lambda
calculus. This interpretation should not come as a surprise as he
augments his monad with the
\emph{choose} operator which tightly resembles a stochastic choice.

Both Ramsey and Scibior interpret the monad into measure terms.
This interpretation yields an argument of the soundness of their monadic approaches.

We will not look further into the formal definitions other than referring
to \cite{Ramsey:2002, Scibior:2015}.
