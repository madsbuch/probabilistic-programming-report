\section{Research Questions}
This area is still emerging, and as such, much of the material is rather new.
Following is a select list of research questions from the literature. It
should provide an idea of the current state of this field.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Operations based on sampling:} Evidently it is not tractable
      to implement exact methods of certain operations. Hence we need to
      approximate them. A neat foundation for this would be sampling as it is
      cheap and does not require any introspection on the distribution.
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} This is an extension of above. The process
      should be fast enough to achieve good results in feasible time.
      Parallelization is a hot topic, and plenty of specialized hardware for the
      purpose exist. Hence efficient parallel implementation of sampling based
      operations would push this field into a useful state.
    \item \textbf{Formal semantics:} The body of work is quite small in this area of
      providing a formal semantics for these constructions. A formal semantics
      would increase the reliability on the constructions and provide deeper
      insights into their applications.
\end{itemize}

Many more questions exist. A good starting point is \cite{Scibior:2015}.
