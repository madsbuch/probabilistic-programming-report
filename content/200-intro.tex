%Introduction
Probabilistic reasoning is a fundamental technique for assessing security risks.
In this part, we will look into two security relevant subjects: Quantitative
information flow and cryptography.

In quantitative information flow, we are interested in how much
information flows from one entity to another in a system. To uncover
covert channels we consider models of the computations.

In cryptography, we are interested in assessing the difficulty in retrieving
the clear text of some encrypted string. Here we are interested in doing
proofs that reduce the hardness of a protocol to something that we
consider hard. For this, we use the notion of game-based security proofs.
These can be formalized using the monadic approach presented in Part 1.
